Hello! My name’s zoey Globe,

I'm a Linux-loving creative kitty-girl from England. I'm female, and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I'm transgender, and otherkin (cat-kin, I really am a cat). Currently spending lots of my time writing small bits of open-source software for Linux, and doing web development, and trying to learn Python, so I can be more useful in doing things. 

Generally I'm quite the nerd, a fan of technology, programming, computer hardware & software, games, Linux, that kind of thing. My large interest in gaming extends into an interest in game design, game development, modding, mapping, etc- but that's something I'm still learning to be able to achieve.

I’m an open-source advocate, and recommend and prioritise the use of free libre software, and open non-proprietary services– but that doesn’t mean I’m a die-hard only-FLOSS extremist. I'm reasonable.

Web development is probably where my future is, that or some kind of a PC systems administrator, or game developer. I love writing lots of HTML, CSS, and Bash, have dabbled in Batch, and C64 Basic.

Recently I’ve been trying to get into writing more, but it's always quite difficult. Even writing this page was a multi-day struggle, for me, but hopefully I'll become and remain more practiced with time.

I have a YouTube channel, on which you can expect videos randomly and without schedule. I've been trying to get into making videos more over time, but it's slow progress, because sometimes I'm a perfectionist, so making and editing videos takes a while, but feel free to subscribe to see when I do: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHPRv42hwuIE6ZIi8c96H2g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHPRv42hwuIE6ZIi8c96H2g)

Sorry if my writing or sentence structure seems awkward or confusing sometimes, or something doesn’t make sense, I have autism, and likely other neurodivergences- it shouldn’t affect anything much, but please ask for clarity if I ever say something you’re unsure of. I can also be quite shy, sometimes, and I apologise for that.

I signed up for and filled in a pronouns.page for myself, please see it to learn my pronouns, name, species, things I am, and am proud of. Also included are a small selection of words I feel comfortable being used for me, so you can get the general theme of how I'd prefer you refer to me. Please take a look: [https://en.pronouns.page/@itszoeyglobe](https://en.pronouns.page/@itszoeyglobe)

Feel free to e-mail me with whatever you'd please, thoughts, feedback, etc. - zoeyglobe@gmail.com

I plan to add more to this site with time, and also register to use other websites! It's slow progress, but I will.

Have a wonderful day.
